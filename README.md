## 🔒 Security Notes

- Change `JWT_SECRET` before any public deployment
- Consider adding HTTPS via a reverse proxy (Traefik, Caddy)
- The default admin password should be changed on first login
- For production, consider replacing SQLite with PostgreSQL

## 🛠 Development

To run the API locally without Docker:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
```

The frontend is a single HTML file — open it in any browser or serve via any static server.
